# Things needed
* Game Over Screen (brought up by Osvaldo)
* Stuff from Media
  * This includes:
    * Clock Images
    * The library
    * Zoomed in images of the bookshelves
    * Implementation of the key to the drawer
    * The secret passage opening
    * Functionality of picking up books
    * Everything from the Master Bedroom
    * Everything from the Bathroom
    * Text Boxes (idk what style we are going for) [my first thought were textboxes from Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword but seeing as how we won't have many we dont need to make things like that and focus more on functionality]
    * Intro Cutscene (I will refer to this as scene 0)
    * Ending Cutscene (I will refer to this as scene 1)
* Leaderboard Functionality
* Inventory Functionality (I want to be able to purposely drop a book so that it never sees the light of day again)
  * Inventory Viewing (seems to work now)

* Optional Stuff to prioritize Later:
  * Making the arrows look pretty and not out of place blue buttons
  * Text Boxes look pretty
  * F i r e
  * Default Music (I had an idea for something creepy but it is very much so copyrighted :/)
  * Area introductions (my current idea for this would be introduction to areas from Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword but 1. this is not the thing to focus on and 2. I am DEFINITELY not media)


## NOTE: I (Benjamin) AM NOT MEDIA OR IN MEDIA GROUP SO ANY SUGGESTIONS MADE BY ME ARE JUST WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT OF AND ARE THUS *NOT NEEDED* PRIORITIZE WHAT MEDIA GROUP SAYS ON THE MATTER OVER MY IDEAS
